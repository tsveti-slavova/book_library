            With the idea of imparting programming 
            knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain, an IIT Roorkee 
            alumnus started a dream, GeeksforGeeks. 
            Whether programming excites you or you feel 
            stifled, wondering how to prepare for 
            interview questions or how to ace data 
            structures and algorithms, GeeksforGeeks 
            is a one-stop solution. With every tick of 
            time, we are adding arrows in our quiver.
            From articles on various computer science 
            subjects to programming problems for practice,
            from basic to premium courses, from technologies
            to entrance examinations, we have been building
            ample content with superior quality. In a short
            span, we have built a community of 1 Million+ 
            Geeks around the world, 20,000+ Contributors and
            500+ Campus Ambassador in various colleges across
            the nation. Our success stories include a lot of
            students who benefitted in their placements and 
            landed jobs at tech giants. Our vision is to 
            build a gigantic network of geeks and we are 
            only a fraction of it yet.
